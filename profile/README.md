What is the Electric Tantra Linux
  </summary>
    <br/>
    <blockquote>
    <p>My dotfiles, aka Linux configuration. which I am working on packaging together inside an ISO for easy distribution to interested 3rd parties. </p>
    <p>While finishing that up, I have moved all of my dotfiles to the present organization as a means of organizing my projects using the built in organization functionality provided by Github.</p>

Where Did the AwesomeWM Configuration Go?
  </summary>
  
<br/>
      <blockquote>
<p> For now, it is set to private. When it is ready it will be made public again. </p>
  <p> When it is done, feature branches will mark Reddit posts, such as to enable those in the future looking for an old configuration to find it without sorting through a bunch of junk in the configuration itself. </p>

When Will It Be Ready?
  </summary>
  <br/>
      <blockquote>
  <p> Soon I hope... </p>
  <p>This project has required a lot of research and experimentation in order to acheive a functional state, thus it has at times dragged on due to new configuratons to pick apart and my perfectionism, since its my daily driver I have let my perfectionism run free with it.</p>
