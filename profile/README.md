Where Did the AwesomeWM Configuration Go?
  </summary>
  <ul>
<li> Because *certain individuals* in  the awesome ricing community like to borrow other people's code then **not attribute in any way** the source of that code (which I at least have links to where ideas came from in my files and am making an Awesome list with everyone's configurations on it) the awesome configuration is private until a release is ready. At that time I will create a branch for the version at the time its posted on reddit and the discussions page on Github so people in the future can access the **actual version they see in the screenshot** evuidently a novel thought among those in the community. <br/> I an akk about using other people's configurations and code to generate your own, but that's going to have to wait until I release the thing. Sorry not sorry, learn to attribute. A link at the top of the file is not a burden, in fact its very helpful for later reference. </li>
