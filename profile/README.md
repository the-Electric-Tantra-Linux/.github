the Project
  </summary>
  <ul>
<li> The projects that are this organization's repositories are in total the working environment that I use on Linux. Without some means of demonstrating them, there would be no way to utilize these projects, each requiring significant amounts of time and energy, within my portfolio for employers to consider. </li>
    <li>Additionally for those without the experience or patience to replicate this environment, the nuances of it might be lost were one to simply look over the `awesomewm` configuration or otherwise examine a portion of the code without the rest of the components within it. </li>
<li> For those new to Arch, AwesomeWM, the Linux ricing community, prospective employers or other interested third parties, I have packaged it in an ISO such that you may run it as it is in Virtualbox or some other type 2 hyoervisor and experience the opinionated but potent desktop environment I have tailor made for Linux. </li>
